# Laravel Task: Form with Validation

## Overview

Build a form for creating and updating tasks using Laravel. Apply validation using **Form Request** classes for both Store and Update operations.

---

## Additional Conditions

### Update Handling

* Validation must pass if the **title is not changed**
* Ignore the current task ID in the unique rule

### Security

* Ensure the submitted **creator_id exists in the database**
* Ensure the submitted **user_id exists in the database**
* Prevent sending invalid or non-existing IDs

### Error Handling

* Display validation error messages clearly in the view
* Customize default error messages to be more descriptive and user-friendly

---

## Relationships & Features

### Polymorphic Comments

Add comments using a **polymorphic relationship**.

* Reference: https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent-relationships#polymorphic-relationships
* Do NOT use a one-to-many relationship
* Reason: to reuse the same comments table for other models (e.g., tasks, posts, images)

---

### Comments

* A task can have multiple comments
* A comment belongs to a user
* A comment belongs to a commentable model (task via polymorphic relation)

---

### User Relations

* A task belongs to a user (creator)
* A task can be assigned to a user (assignee)
* A user can have many tasks
* A user can have many comments

---

### Task Relations

* A task can have many comments
* A task belongs to a creator (user)
* A task belongs to an assignee (user)

---

### Requirements for Comments

* Comment body is required
* Each comment must be linked to:

    * an existing user (`exists:users,id`)
    * a valid commentable model

---

### Additional Features

* Use **Eager Loading** to optimize queries and avoid the N+1 problem

    * Example:

        * `Task::with(['creator', 'assignee', 'comments.user'])->get()`

* Display the commenter's information with each comment
